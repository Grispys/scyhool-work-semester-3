# JAVASCRIPT QAP 1

## NAME: pass-gen

pass-gen is a password generator cli app I made for my QAP 1 in javascript.
You will find it in the 'javascript' folder under 'pass-gen'
use the --help flag to see how it works once you have it running.

## Why is it in your main branch for the entire semester 3?
Uh. I forgot to create a seperate folder in my VScode before creating the folder and before I knew it i had it committed. I did create a seperate branch and merge it back into the main
for the customization features. In all honesty, I am too scared of breaking it if I were to move it. All of the commit messages for this project ARE in here, they might just be in the 'Java' folder.
I am terribly sorry.
